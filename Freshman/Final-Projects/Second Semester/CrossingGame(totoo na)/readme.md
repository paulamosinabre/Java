<p>PS: Yes, wala akong balak i-delete yung previous files because I believe those are the ones that contribute to our growth; they mold us into a better person, a better developer, a better sister, a better daughter, and a better classmate (haha). We should have a compilation of our files because in the future, if we saw our code when we were just starting, we would realize how much we grew, how much we are better now, and how much we improved.</p>
<p>Love lots, self</p>
