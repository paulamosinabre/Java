<p>PS: Yes, wala akong balak i-delete yung previous files because I belive those are the ones that contibutes to our growth, it molds us into a better person, a beter developer,
a better sister, a better daughter, and a better classmate(haha). We should have a have a compilation of our files because in the future if we saw our code when we were just starting, we realize how much we grow, how much we are better now, how much we improved.</p>
